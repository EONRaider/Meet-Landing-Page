## My process

1. I started with the markup on index.html, complying with HTML5 semantic tags and standards as much as possible.
2. The styling provided by the meet-landing-page briefing was implemented first, followed by the classes I came up with
   on the
   markup.
3. I used Figma to acquire all the right dimensions involved in the layout and implemented them in the appropriate CSS
   classes.
4. The [CSS Cube](https://cube.fyi/) methodology was used when coding the stylesheet and some of the conventions from
   BEM were used when naming classes.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Cube CSS methodology

### What I learned

- I've noticed an increase in my proficiency with the Cube CSS methodology. Some of its most subtle details are not
  obvious from the get go, especially rules related to separation of concerns between the various sections that compose
  the
  code.
